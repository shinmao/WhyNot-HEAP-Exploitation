## What's House-Of-Force?  
I am so amazed with such kind of attack when I first time heared it, it is a kind of attack that we **deceive** the glibc!  
What?Deceive the allocator?! I will explain it in the following.  

### Malloc More Memory
We should know that when malloc(nb) find there is no anymore chunk can be used in the bin, it will call **TOP** chunk for help!  
First, we will check the size header of TOP.  
If **top_size - nb - 0x10(size of header) > 0**, then we can get nb from the top chunk.

### How do we Exploit
When we get our requested memory, we should also have the new address of top chunk.  
```
new_top = old_top + nb + size_of_chunk_header
//In other hands >
nb = new_top - old_top - size_of_chunk_header
```  
So in fact, we can control our address of top chunk through the rule!  
  
### Steps of Force  
The keypoint of this attack is to make sure **where you want to move your top** and **how much is your nb**.  
1. **Override TOP side to Big Value**  
When the program has the vulnerability of heap overflow, we can override the header of the next chunk.  
In this case, we need to make sure that we can malloc() again from **TOP** chunk, so I would override the size of chunk with **0xffffffffffffffff**.  
(Why we need to make sure the fact above? Because only malloc we can change again the address of top chunk:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:  
2. malloc(**new_top - old_top - size_of_chunk_header**)  
We always want to hijack the function, so I can try to move our top close to the function ptr, then I can override the RIP.  
So, we may decide the **new_top** by ourselves.  
However, you must be confused that the value of nb is negative!:scream:  
In fact, nb can be a negative number because size-t in malloc() function is also a signed number.  
Then, we move our top chunk to our target site ><  
3. malloc() again  
In the end, when you malloc again, you can gain control over the target!  

**Make sure where you are now and we can start overriding our function ptr**

Dive into the picture above, then you can understand more~  
  
### Requirements  
So, what are our requirements?  
1. We can overflow the **size header of TOP chunk**.  
2. We can control the size of our malloc()
