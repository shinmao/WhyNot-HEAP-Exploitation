1. Trigger __int_free() with sysmalloc()  
2. Unosrted bin attack  
3. FSOP  
  
## 1. Trigger sysmalloc  
In the first step, we would like to leak libc and heap base address.    
From beginning, we always have TOP with size of 0x21000.  
Here, we malloc(0x400 - 0x10), so the TOP size is left with 0x20c01.  
Now, we have a method to **make this TOP CHUNK to be a freed chunk**.  
```
I would like to draw a picture just like shellphish <3  
          |------------|------------|------..--|
          |    chunk   |    chunk   | Top  ..  |
          |------------|------------|------..--|
     heap start                            heap end  
     
       
          |------------|------------|------..--|--...--|---------|
          |    chunk   |    chunk   | free ..  |  ...  | new Top |
          |------------|------------|------..--|--...--|---------|
     start                            old top                 new end  
```  
1) Overflow to forge the size of TOP chunk.  
2) Malloc a chunk which is bigger than TOP chunk (e.g. malloc(0x1000)  
3) The OLD TOP would be freed into unsorted bins with two conditions...  
   * old TOP address + forged size need to be page aligned. (x000)  
   * prev_inuse bit has to be set.  
4) The freed TOP chunk in unsorted bin have fd, bk pointing to libc  
Now, we can leak!  
  
## 2. unsorted bin attack
